        <h2>Multimedia Online Information Environment Characterization Framework</h2>

        <p>In recent years, several frameworks have been proposed to communicate 
            and characterize disinformation campaigns and incidents of information 
            manipulation and interference online, while some have been incorporated 
            into the existing institutional frameworks by government agencies and 
            industry. Some of the proposed frameworks aimed at systematic 
            documentation and communication of reported campaigns across 
            institutions, while others focused on the characterization of behaviors, 
            tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by threat actors. Also, a
            few frameworks characterize the narrative and rhetorical characteristics of 
            influence in general. The existing frameworks offer great value in overall 
            understanding and timely detection of influence operations. However, almost
            all the proposed frameworks cannot address the emerging developments in 
            the modern information environment and pose a number of limitations to the
            characterization of high-risk hostile influence operations. In this study, we 
            emphasize the use of multimedia environments, including video, audio, real-
            time broadcasting, and real-time audio chat environments for online 
            influence operations as a high-priority area of focus for an additional 
            computational and analytical framework. All in all, we posit that the 
            expansion of the current set of frameworks with a multi-modal approach 
            toward such social media platforms would improve the efforts to monitor, 
            track, detect, and mitigate the emerging threats in the information 
            environment.

            <p>
                The state-of-the-art characterization frameworks have several limitations as 
                mentioned below.
            </p>
           
            <p>
                1. Most critical limitation of existing characterization frameworks stems from
                the fact that they do not consider the dynamic characterization of 
                information actors (producers and consumers) and the information 
                campaign process. To develop a rich understanding of the OIE, all three 
                elements are critical, i.e., tactics, information actors, and the campaignâ€™s 
                dynamics. Our characterization framework considers the information actor
                and the campaign dynamics to develop effective countermeasures.
            </p> 
            <p>
            2. Existing characterization frameworks exclude comprehensive evaluation 
            of non-textual data, platform affordances, and metadata such as audio, 
            video, engagement statistics, recommendation information, and dynamic 
            network information. Further, time series data analysis needs to be 
            considered for a near real time evaluation. Our characterization 
            framework considers all the above-mentioned data elements as well as 
            time series information.
        </p>
        <p>3. There is not much focus on impact assessment in existing frameworks. 
            These frameworks mainly focus on defining TTPs and identifying/detecting
            these and not on impact assessment. In our approach, we address these 
            gaps. Further, our approaches have rigorous theoretical and 
            mathematical grounding.

        </p>
        <p>
            
            We are developing a characterization framework for multimedia-rich social 
            platforms. The framework addresses the gaps in the current frameworks 
            (discussed above) and presents novel ways of characterization of 
            multimedia-rich social platform-based behaviors. The framework also 
            provides analytical tools to not only identify such behaviors but also measure
            their impact.
            Our characterization framework considers five approaches: </p>
            <p> &#8226; Characterizing multimedia OIE tactics and impact assessment;</p>
            <p> &#8226; Characterizing dynamics of social/campaign process for better 
                characterization of campaign phases;</p>
            <p>&#8226; Characterizing information actors (producers and consumers) 
                dynamically; </p>
            <p>  &#8226; Characterizing network coordination structures; and</p>

            <p>&#8226; Characterizing mobs and their dynamics.</p>

           
            
          
            
            These characterization approaches afford understanding of multimedia OIE 
            from a multidimensional and dynamic perspective to develop 
            countermeasures/ intervention strategies and further measure response 
            effectiveness.
            These approaches have rigorous mathematical and theoretical grounding for 
            better explainability, interpretability, and transparency. Figure below 
            illustrates our characterization approaches.</p>
