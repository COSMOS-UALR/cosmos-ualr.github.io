                <p>
                    Multimedia rich OIE specific tactics are multifaceted and use multiple modalities of information. We
                    will explain how we characterize these tactics and conduct impact assessment. Various multimedia
                    rich OIE specific tactics have been identified in our studies and from the literature. These tactics
                    are characterized by their multi-faceted detection and impact assessment, i.e., network (N), content
                    (C), and/or platform affordance (P). Each of these facets (network, content, and platform
                    affordance) in turn requires analysis of a variety of information modalities (text, audio, video,
                    images, network, URLs, metadata, algorithms, etc.). A content taxonomy of the various information
                    modalities is included
                    <br><br>
                    A list of these tactics is presented below, along with their respective characterization (N, C,
                    and/or P), also illustrated in Figure 1:

                    <br>&#x2022; Long term/short term game (P)

                    <br>&#x2022; Emotion/Toxicity cue (C,N)

                    While some tactics leverage content, network, or platform affordances, others depend on a combination of two or all three facets. For instance, content cloning/repurposing leverages content facet, however, coordinated content push leverages both content and network facet. On the other hand, coordinated deep fake tactic leverages all three facets, i.e., network, content, and platform affordance. Figure 2 illustrates this multi-faceted characterization of multimedia rich OIE specific tactics by positioning the tactic closer to the facets leveraged by the said tactic.

                    For each tactic, we are developing and refining analytics to detect and measure its impact. These
                    analytics are presented as a playbook to show what data elements are needed, how to process the data
                    elements, and the analytical methodology to detect and measure the impact. A comprehensive
                    characterization of the rich data environment of multimedia OIE and characterization of multimodal
                    multimethod analytical methodologies for multimedia OIE are depicted in Figures 3 and 4,
                    respectively.

                <h5>Commenter Flash Mob</h5>
                <h6>Definition</h6>
                <p>A type of coordinated inauthentic behavior, commenter flash mob is a tactic where a seemingly
                    arbitrary group of commenters collectively comment on a (or a set of) video(s). Such an act seems
                    uncoordinated to an outsider but there is a sophisticated coordination in their activity, like a
                    flash mob. Their comments may or may not be relevant to the video content. Some examples of
                    coordinated commenter flash mobs are shown in Figure 1 (left). As a contrasting example, a regular
                    commenter behavior is shown in Figure 1 (right). Some of the commenter flash mobs shown in figure 1
                    (left) comprises of groups of commenters who co-commented on over 100 videos. Such commenter flash
                    mobs can create a perception of a content being popular thereby helping increase its virality.

                <h5>Coordinated Content Push</h5>
                <h5>Definition</h5>
                <p>A type of coordinated behavior, coordinated content push is a tactic where a group of information
                    actors (e.g., channels on YouTube) post identical or similar content. The group of information
                    actors could post identical videos, similar videos, portions of a video embedded in another, may use
                    similar content production styles, similar background/foreground images in their video, same/similar
                    audio, speech, text, etc. Figure 1 shows two different channels that pushed same videos with
                    identical titles. Further, the group members may also follow each other (as subscribers) and/or
                    deploy other tactics such as commenter flash mobs. Often content from the group of channels is
                    recommended by the platform and shows up in the â€˜related videosâ€™ stream of each other.

                <h5>Discourse/Narrative Fusion</h5>
                <h6>Definition</h6>
                <p>
                    Discourse/narrative fusion is a tactic where different topics (that may or may not be related) are injected in a discourse in an attempt to conflate issues, raise popularity/visibility of one topic through the other, bridge related echo chambers, and fabricate a perception of relevance of the topic or support for the topic in society. This tactic could also result in exploitation of algorithmic bias. Narrative/discourse mixing could also help in detection of code-switching tactics. 
                    <br>Commenter networks stretch beyond a channel. Cross-channel commenter networks allow identification of discourse fusion tactics. Figure 1 (left) shows an example of isolated discourse on YouTube. The discourse tends to stay localized to a video or a channel. Commenters prefer to stick to a channel or a video. They comment and leave. Isolated discourse is largely observed on mainstream news and politics category channels. People rarely watch the same news on different YouTube channels much less commenting on the same news story on different channels, hence a very sparsely brokered discourse network. On the other hand, Figure 1 (right) shows an example of discourse fusion tactic, where people have bridged various discourse communities by co-commenting. In this example, people have co-commented on a variety of COVID-19 misinformation promoting videos, anti-vaccination ideology promoting videos, and conspiracy theory promoting content on YouTube. Thereby, creating a highly brokered discourse network that pushes YouTubeâ€™s algorithms to consider such content related and show them as such in related video streams.

                <p>Figure 2 shows a group of information actors on YouTube that deployed coordinated content push
                    tactic. These channels posted highly similar to identical videos, with same/similar titles,
                    same/similar audio transcript, and used robotic voice narration. Further, these channels also
                    deployed commenter flash mob tactic. Due to these tactics, content from these channels show up in
                    each otherâ€™s related video stream.
