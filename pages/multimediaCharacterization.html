                <h5>Multimodal Characterization of Incidents in Multimedia Online Information Environment</h5>
                <p>
                    The following section outlines the data and content types, and analytical approaches we have focused on in our research in recent years. Our goal is to combine the given components in an overarching conceptual framework to support the current efforts to characterize relevant incidents and campaigns in the information environment.                </p>

                    <p>Video barcode extraction and color theory-based assessment enable the detection and characterization of inauthentic, manipulative, or suspicious content amplification behaviors. Video barcode analysis enables the extraction of similar and almost identical video objects through a scalable and very fast embedding of each video in a low-dimensional space that may include a very high number of videos. This characterization can also be elevated to group-level by focusing on channels, content producers, topical content groups, or other groups that exhibit network structures. In addition to the content amplification aspect, the deeper analysis of video barcodes and underlying color signals may enable the identification of intent, motivation, as well as the systematic use of emotional and cognitive cues in the content promoted by threat actors. Such signals do not necessarily exist and are identifiable in text-based approaches other existing methods are built on.</p>
                    <p>Other computational frameworks for video-based characterization include detection or classification of objects, detection of scenes, or detection of movements. Although this line of research is currently developing and the existing products achieve varying performance with significant computational requirements, it is a valuable addition to the workflows that aim at characterizing the video objects that become the artifacts of hostile influence operations. Using object, face, movement, and scene detection techniques, we can identify the repetitive and systematic content production tactics. In addition, analysts can retrieve sets of computationally embedded entities (objects, persons, graphical/visual items) from resulting databases that include previously identified incidents, campaigns, or content.</p>

                        In addition to images and videos, sophisticated influence operations utilize audio for increasing the impact on human behaviors, beliefs, and cognition. For example, audio signals often include emotional triggers (such as anger, disgust, or fear) that increase the penetration capabilities of amplified messages or narratives. The existing text-based analytical frameworks can't capture such operational and increasingly significant traces. Video-based platforms such as YouTube and TikTok, and audio-based artifacts such as podcasts and live community-level audio-chats (Clubhouse, Twitter’s Spaces, etc.), have been becoming the core pillars of online information dissemination, often facilitating the rapid spread of messages that are untraceable through text-based computational workflows. Although the frameworks such as BEND maneuvers include psycholinguistic features embedded in the text, they often rely on bag-of-words techniques to analyze text. Both audio and video data are represented in higher dimensions than text. Emotional cues are often hidden in the audio signals such as peaks and emphasis on words (intonations) or even lower-level segments of speech. Therefore, our current line of work includes the characterization of audio signals.

                        In combination with video-based and audio-based signals, textual features enrich the analysis and characterization of influence operations in multimedia environments. Adding to the existing analytical frameworks that characterize narrative and content-specific attributes, the multi-modal approach adopted by our techniques aims at the characterization of features associated with the "content producers" (actor) and "content consumers" (target audience). For example, textual data such as video transcripts, channel descriptions, video titles, and video descriptions signal behavioral characteristics of content producers on YouTube, especially when jointly embedded with video, audio, network, and engagement-specific features. Secondly, textual attributes extracted from comments, commenters, reply to comments, and conversational threads signal the basic characteristics of target audiences as well as their reactions to the incoming streams of targeted information. Therefore, by combining the text-based features with other components of the multi-modal computational framework, we also aim at capturing the impact or degree of influence operations that are being assessed.

                        More often than not, the existing frameworks of disinformation and social cybersecurity incidents include network-centric approaches to uncover tactical, technical, behavioral, and procedural traces of influence operations on online platforms. As demonstrated in the previous reports, networks of commenter cliques and mobs provide strong signals of inauthentic behaviors across YouTube channels. While many commenter mobs from one video to another of the same channel, some mobs are shown to span across different channels to effect discourse fusion – a tactic known to manipulate recommendation algorithm (more on this is covered in section on “Platform Affordances”). In addition, platforms such as YouTube also include channel subscriber or shared-commenter networks, which further show the latent connections between content producer and disseminator entities.

                        In recent years, the popularity of graph machine learning algorithms has increased across a wide variety of application domains. Relevant to this work, both earlier graph representation techniques and newer graph deep neural networks are proposed for fraud detection, threat hunting (cybersecurity), fake news propagation detection, and coordination detection tasks. As an example of the use cases of more traditional and older methods, a recent study combined "shallow" graph embedding techniques (node2vec) with text embedding to classify malicious news sharing networks of coordinated accounts. However, modern graph learning algorithms enable even better results. The primary strength of graph learning algorithms comes from their ability to capture structural information, hierarchical relationships, and features related to information flows in networks. Graph representation learning and graph neural networks constitute a branch of machine learning research, with several similarities to modern image recognition systems and transformer-based language models such as widely adopted BERT, GPT-3, and others

                    <p>
                        Graph learning approaches can be applied to any network-related data, hence enabling many non-trivial solutions to problems about online information flows, social networks, and popular social media platforms. In particular, when combined with other state-of-the-art deep learning systems of NLP, computer vision, and even traditional machine learning, graph neural networks may enable significant improvements to the abovementioned problem areas. On the other hand, networks (graphs) consist of irregular and asymmetric structures and they are with dynamic complexities. Therefore the graph learning approaches require special handling due to their differences from modern deep learning applications such as image recognition. For example, in recent years, multiple methods have been proposed by diverse research groups to "detect fake news" (some of these tasks look more like the detection of behaviors). The proposed solutions tackle different problems such as predicting the fake content, detecting bots, detecting rumor sources, and detecting fake news/disinformation propagation networks. More often than not, the promising solutions combine multiple machine learning tasks.
                        <br>In the context of this project, graph representation learning would enable the "mapping" and 2D/3D representation of detected information incidents (each incident as a graph, each graph as an entity in the final space), especially in comparison with instances of similar incidents over time, and with information incidents led by other actors. For example, we may be able to represent the similarities and differences of incidents (distance), in terms of the information captured by the respective coordination networks, and their structural properties. When needed, the networks can be supported by additional layers of information with applications of computer vision (use of similar images) or natural language processing (textual content).

                        Despite a limited view of user engagements on amplified pieces of information, most of the current frameworks do not capture the meaningful analysis of engagements within the context of influence operations. Social media listening tools and relevant computational workflows often include engagement metrics as a proxy for the overall reach of any content. However, multimedia platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, and some audio-based platforms are often vulnerable to coordinated manipulation of user engagements. Across the world, many commercial black-market and PR entities offer such manipulation as part of their "disinformation as a service" packages. Also, threat actors that have significant experience, personnel, organizational structure, financial power, and computational infrastructure employ such capabilities in the manipulation of user engagements for further amplification of their messages. Often, multimedia platforms either lack the capabilities to eliminate the manipulation of engagement metrics, or their countermeasures lag behind the attackers, introducing significant time gaps between the initial manipulation and the correction of engagement metrics. Such metrics include the number of views, number of likes, number of comments (with embedded likes, dislikes, and replies), and number of subscribers.

                        Metadata signals enable additional views of influence operations on multimedia environments. For example, data types such as cross-platform URL link networks, location metadata, timestamps (channel, account, producer, video, podcast, comment), and content categories are incorporated in the analysis. Most of the proposed approaches remain focused on a single platform and stop the analytical workflow exactly when the information starts achieving broader impact across multiple or even many social media platforms. Broadening the focus on multimedia platforms and multi-modal computational assessments enable us to detect and characterize additional significant operational traces and discover influence pathways.

                        Multimedia based social platforms being content-centric platforms, afford unique manipulative tools for adversarial information operations. Recommender systems, for instance, have a significant influence on the dissemination and consumption of the content, especially on multimedia platforms. In 2018, YouTube's Chief product officer mentioned that 70% of watch time on YouTube is spent watching videos the algorithm recommends. As already depicted in many studies (including ours), recommender systems exhibit unintended bias and unfair behaviors that lead to the promotion of harmful content or the formation of filter bubbles. Moreover, inauthentic and artificial commenter behaviors, manipulation of user engagements, shilling attacks, exploitation of data voids, and more sophisticated adversarial attacks aim at the alteration of recommender behavior that would promote the content amplified by threat actors. Further, such an approach does not remain limited to actor-networks but also uncovers content networks. Given the architectures of modern social media platforms, once crossing the tipping points of overall reach, content moves and spreads rapidly across many networks. Finally, the current literature suggests that the hyperactive users and content producers achieve higher amplification by platform recommendations. Therefore, the multi-modal assessments of influence campaigns in a framework that includes such multimedia environments should incorporate and combine the network-centric views of content producers, content consumers, and platform recommender systems.
