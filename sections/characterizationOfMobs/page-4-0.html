    <h5>Characterization of Mobs</h5>
    <p>
        Socio-cognitive threats don’t just stay in the cyber world. They can also impact the real world. Digital platforms play a critical role in transforming individuals to groups and groups to mobs – a phenomenon that is rooted in the concept of the crowd mind by Le Bon (1895). Here we present a mob characterization framework and a classification scheme for known mob phenomenon from literature. Note that the classification scheme and the mob characterization framework are dynamic, meaning, they will be updated/refined as newer mob phenomena are detected.

        In recent years, flash mobs have taken a darker twist as criminals exploit the anonymity of crowds, using social networking to coordinate everything from robberies to fights to general chaos (Tucker and Watkins 2011; Steinblatt 2011). More recently, the term “mob” has been increasingly used to remark an electronically orchestrated violence such as the recent attack on the State Capital in Washington by angry protesters that lead to property damages, government disruption, and injuries or death for some of the protesters (W. P. Staff 2021; Barry et al. 2021). In a recent incident, an army of small investors from all over the world used Reddit to coordinate “flashmob investing” (Pratley 2021) to create a stock market frenzy causing GameStop’s stock value to rise from $20 to $483 in less than a month (Brignall 2021). Such events raise the importance of systematically studying such behaviors. 

        Modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) provide affordable and easy to use means of communications (such as social network platforms, viral emails, and SMS) that facilitate and ease the process of recruiting, training, and looking for a specific sector of the society, e.g., specific gender, age, political affiliation, interest, and cultural background. Deviant groups are known to be early adopters of emerging technologies, such as the audio-based app called clubhouse, Twitter’s Spaces, video-based platform called Parler, Rumble, BitChute, etc. They extract every bit of recruitment and propaganda out of it before it gets taken away. We examined the strategic combination of mainstream and fringe social media platforms using social cyber forensic and social network analysis informed methodologies grounded in the theory of collective action and social identity model for deindividuation effect – that is how an individual can lose their identity to the collective in a mob setting (Reicher et al., 1995). We use multimedia data fusion models to allow analysts conduct socio, cognitive, and behavioral assessments. We assess influence and reach of digital activity of extremist groups in (McNerney et al., 2022; Spann & Agarwal, 2022).  

        The ease of use, low to no moderation, and instantaneous global reach has led to an increase in the occurrences of emerging socio‐technical behaviors (Mohilever 2012), including flash mobs. A flash mob or mob, in general, can be considered successful when it succeeds to achieve its goal(s). Mobs can have various goals as explained later ranging from using mob as an educational tool/research method to creating a political or social change to confusing citizens and creating chaos. With the increasing number of organized violent “protests” in recent months, there is a need to systematically study such events and be able to build predictive models to distinguish between benign and deviant/violent/vicious flash mobs. Also, it is essential to discover if a mob is still being practiced by organizations/individual groups to be able to predict its effect and build socio-computational tools that enable authorities to intervene when a flash mob takes a violent or illegal turn to strengthen domestic and national security apparatus.

        We did a comprehensive survey of mobs and developed a mob characterization framework (Al-Khateeb & Agarwal, 2021). Figure 1 depicts a taxonomy of various mob types based on environment, actor, motive, and time. This framework allows us to characterize behaviors and outcomes of a mob. This in turn could allow us to build capabilities that could assist the U.S. DoD in gaining situational awareness and prepare for strategic intervention with mobs that could take a violent turn during military exercises, humanitarian crises, and disaster relief operations or around military bases.

        We will discuss our approach to characterization of mobs leveraging existing literature on this concept. In this summative, chronological, and by topic literature review, we explore the disciplines in which the term “mob” is used, then investigate its various forms for a systematic categorization to eliminate ambiguities.
        Finally, we will shed light on what is missing from the literature and what needs to be studied in the 
        future with regard to this topic. But first, we will provide a characterization framework of mobs and 
        then discuss operationalization of the framework (computationally and for social media). Note that the
         classification scheme and the mob characterization framework are dynamic, meaning, they will be 
         updated/refined as newer mob phenomena are detected.

    <h5>Taxonomy of Mobs</h5>
    <p>
        When a phenomenon is new, mentioned in media, and depends on technology, it is hard to assume that everyone knows its exact meaning (Houston et al. 2013). Also, many traditionalist mobbers became concerned that the global diffusion of flash mobs have diluted their original meaning (Molnár 2014). So, in this systematic, summative, chronological, and by topic literature review-based analysis, we seek answer to a key question - what are the different forms of mobs studied in the literature? Subsequently, what are the common and most agreed‐upon properties that define each of these forms? And, can we categorize the mobs based on their common properties? 

        In this effort, we create a typology for flash mobs by reviewing various scholarly articles. This classificatory study reveals that even though mobs have been used or studied in various disciplines, there is still sporadic literature especially, the ones that focus on the computational aspect of flash mobs. In our previous works, we studied various mobs (particularly flash mobs) using the theory of collective action (Coleman 2017) to understand their formation, model the power that flash mobbers might exert on the outcome of the event (Al‐khateeb and Agarwal 2014a), and the choices flash mobbers might face with regards to participating in flash mobs or not (Al‐khateeb and Agarwal 2014b, 2015b). We operationalized our model using a real‐world case study (Al‐khateeb and Agarwal 2015a). Additionally, we studied the threats that mobs pose to smart city and urban planning policymaking (Alassad et al. 2019), the mobs that spread COVID‐19 conspiracy theories (Alassad et al. 2021a), the mobs that spread adversarial information operations (Alassad et al. 2021b), and the mobs that could lead to violent acts in the real-world (McNerney et al., 2022; Spann & Agarwal, 2022). However, the literature lacks similar attempts. This typology is important because it encapsulates various existing literature and puts forward all the various types of mobs into categories to eliminate any possible ambiguities.

        During the literature survey, we found that the mob phenomenon, which was studied in various articles, was referred to as “flash mob” (Mitchell and Boyod 2012), “classic mob” (Bylieva 2018) (Molnár 2014), “virtuous mob” (Shapiro 2017), “political mob” (Walker 2011), “smart mob” (Tsou 2015), “criminal flash mob” (Steinblatt 2011), or other names. In many cases, they either meant the same thing or in many other cases they meant different things, i.e., the global diffusion of flash mobs has diluted their original meaning. We also did not find any research article that talks about the distinctive characteristics of these different forms of mobs. Hence, after reviewing the literature we propose the term "mob" to be the root term so we can categorize its various forms (branches) and eliminate ambiguities. We define the root term "mob" as an event that is organized via social media, emails, SMS, or other forms of digital communication technologies in which a group of people (who might have an agenda or not) get together online or offline to collectively do something then disperse (quickly or over a longer period of time). The term mob has been used to refer to two distinct types of events:
        Classic Flash Mob, Regular Flash Mob, Traditional Flash Mob, Virtuous Flash Mob, Swarming Art (Nicholson 2005), Guerilla Art (Nicholson 2005), Urban Swarm (Brejzek 2010), or just Flash Mob: these are the events visioned by Bill Wasik when he organized the first flash mob. This subcategory of events must have the following properties: (1) no particular issue or mandate or agenda, (2) happen in public places (popular in large cities), (3) participants perform random acts, (4) have the surprise element (known only to participants so others will be shocked), (5) have no leader, (6) do not include violent acts, and (7) should not last for more than 20 min (Nicholson 2005). For example, the two categories of flash mobs Atomized Flash Mobs and Interactive Flash Mobs identified by Molnár (2014) would fit under this category of the mob. Atomized Flash Mob is defined as a group performs the same activity, does not interact with each other, has no political intent, and disperse within 10 min (Molnár 2014). Interactive Flash Mob is defined as a group in which participants interact with each other and usually last for more than 10 min disrupting urban public spaces. (Molnár 2014).
        Smart mobs: these are the events visioned by Howard Rheingold, in his book “Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution” (Rheingold 2002), i.e., events that have an agenda that can be political, sociological, economic, commercial, or religious. For example, the Performance Flash Mobs, Political Flash Mobs, and Advertising or Commercial or Branded Flash Mobs identified by Molnár (2014) would fit under this category of the mob. Performance Flash Mob is defined as a group that has a stated artistic intent (e.g., to promote performance, an exhibition, or an artist), performs in outdoor spaces, and consists of a large group of strangers as opposed to a few artists in the role of professional provocateurs (Molnár 2014). Political Flash Mob is defined as a group gathers in a specific place to make a political point but without protesting, it is different than the smart mob in that it adopts guerilla‐type tactics and an element of absurdity, e.g., gathering in a place and eating ice cream in front of the police (Molnár 2014). Advertising Flash Mob is defined as an event staged by professional advertising agencies that perform in quasi‐public commercial spaces such as shopping malls to promote a company, a service, or a product (Molnár 2014). Smart mobs also should benefit a group of people (i.e., there should be some utility gained by participating beyond just the fun part) (Nicholson 2005) and can last for more than 20 min, e.g., the Arab Spring in 2010. Other names of mobs that fall under the Smart mobs’ category include:
        Deviant Cyber Flash Mobs (Al‐khateeb and Agarwal 2019) or Vicious Flash Mobs (Shapiro 2017): These are smart mobs (with agenda) and include deviant acts. For example, the Violent Youth Flash Mobs (Houston et al. 2013), Criminal Flash Mobs (Steinblatt 2011), Flash Robs (Bylieva 2018; Steinblatt 2011), and Rolezinho (Bylieva 2018) would fit under this category of mobs.
        Long-Mobs such as the Internet mobs, I-mobs, or Virtual Flash Mobs: These are the events in which people do the same action but not coincide in time, i.e., asynchronously (i.e., last more than 20 min) and mostly happens in the cyberspace (not always though). For example, the Virtual Flash Mobs (Bylieva 2018) are events in which participants are required to write some text, post a picture, press like button, retweet, answer a specific question, etc., using a specific hashtag. These events do not have to happen all at once and can last for a month or more such as the Zombies Mobs (Do Vale 2010), the Ice Bucket Challenge in 2014, or Human Flesh Search, a.k.a. “Renrou Sousuo” (Tsou 2015). Renrou Sousuo is an internet mob phenomenon that started in 2001 in China in which individuals are recruited online or offline to identify non‐moral individuals and try to punish them (usually by exposing their identity) because the law did not count their non‐moral act as a crime (Tsou 2015).

    <h5>Mob Characterization Framework and Operationalization</h5>
    <p>
        Figure 2 shows a decision tree-based classification scheme that uses the three factors we found in the
        literature, i.e., agenda, synchronicity, and the existence of violent acts that seem to distinguish the subcategories of our root term, i.e., mob (which is shown at the bottom of the figure to indicate that all these various subcategories are part of our proposed term).
        Using these findings, we can categorize mobs in general into four main non‐exclusive categories. 
        These non‐exclusive mob categories can be based on the environment, actor type, length of the mob, and 
        the motive of the mobbers. Figure 3 shows our four main categories and subcategories. It’s worth noting that the term “crowd” refers to “an organized event occurring within a defined space, which is attended by a large number of people... not dependent on the reason for the gathering” (Zeitz et al. 2009). Note that the classification scheme and the mob characterization framework are dynamic,
        meaning, they will be updated/refined as newer mob phenomena are detected.

     <h5>Mob Organization Playbook</h5>
     <p>
        It is important to discuss the mob organization process in general (a mob organization playbook of sorts) and data collection avenues for researchers to conduct an in-depth study of the mob phenomenon. 

        The mob organization process (see Figure 4) includes the planning phase, the recruitments phase, the execution phase, the replaying and republishing of the products of the mob phase such as a retweet on Twitter, a Facebook post, or a YouTube video (Zellner et al. 2011), and the evaluation phase where the mob organizers evaluate what worked and what did not – i.e., lessons learned, etc. Several articles in the literature claimed that the organizers of the mob cared immensely about posting the mob's video online and mostly on YouTube (i.e., the replaying and republishing phase).
         Some of them even considered recording the mob and posting it on YouTube more important than the mob itself, because it gives the people the capability to re-watch the mob, which is not possible without recording and posting online (Venning 2012). As Lissa Soep has called it the “digital afterlife” (Soep 2012), which has a significant “potential for a reaction and recontextualization by other users” (Soep 2012). 
        Hence, we posit a need to study mobs on YouTube. There are many mob videos posted on YouTube. A quick Internet search for mobs on YouTube returns over 6 million hits at the time of writing this (i.e., September 19, 2022). Data collection and analysis can be conducted to understand the viewers' behavior toward the various mob categories. Analyzing such large data through the theoretical framework presented above would allow us to better characterize mobs, mobbers’ behaviors, and outcomes. 

        Various websites function as clearinghouses for flash mob organizers and practitioners by offering information on upcoming mob events. We compiled a list of organizations with their websites that were mentioned in the literature known to frequently organize mob events along with their working condition. The list shown below proves that there are still organizations that organize mobs (8 out of the 14 URLs mentioned in the literature are still operational and have a lot of information about upcoming or recurring mobs) and the flash mob phenomenon is not dead yet.
        Also, these URLs serve as a good starting point for researchers interested in collecting data about mobs, i.e., time, location, the goal of the event, etc. Additionally, these websites can guide researchers to collect more data about a specific mob. For example, if a mob is advertised on one of these websites and has a Facebook page or a Twitter account, then the researcher can leverage this information and collect data from that social media platform to further analyze the mob in near-real time manner or even historically. Cyber commentaries on YouTube and Facebook pages are usually written by supporters and/or participants of mobs while blogs and online news sources attract “more heterogeneous readership and offer a glimpse of strong criticism that is also directed at mobs” (Molnár 2014). So, the more diverse the collected data is (in terms of data sources and audience) the better the analysis would be.
