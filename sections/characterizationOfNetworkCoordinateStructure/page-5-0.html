    <h5>Characterization of Network Coordination Structure</h5>
    <p>
        We will discuss our approach to characterization of network coordination structures. We will first
        provide a theoretical framework, then we will discuss operationalization of these constructs
        (computationally and for social media). The network coordination structure characterization
        framework (depicted in Figure 1) leverages our focal structure analysis methodology.

    <h5>Focal Structure Analysis</h5>

    <p>
        Focal structures are key sets of individuals who may be responsible for coordinating events,
        protests, or leading citizen engagement efforts on social media networks. Discovering focal
        structures that are able to promote online social campaigns is important but complex. Unlike
        influential individuals, focal structures can affect large-scale complex social processes. In our
        prior work, we applied a greedy algorithm and bi-level decomposition optimization solution to
        identify focal structures in social media networks. However, the outcomes lacked a contextual
        representation of the focal structures that affected interpretability. To address this limitation, we
        have developed the contextual focal structure analysis (CFSA) model that enhances the
        discovery and interpretability of the key coordinating units of the network (Alassad and Agarwal,
        2022). The model provided context in terms of the content shared by the focal structures through
        their communication network. The model utilizes multiplex networks, where one layer is the user
        network based on communications and social network relations (such as mentions, replies,
        friends, followers, etc.) and the second layer is the content co-occurrence network (such as
        hashtags, topics, comments, etc.). The two layers have interconnections based on the user content
        relations.
        To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first effort in identifying influential sets of
        individuals instead of a set of influential individuals and reveals their interest on social networks.
        Very little research is available that investigates identifying key malicious groups spreading
        misinformation in social networks. To mention a few, researchers measured central users based
        on their influence in the network, resources they are consuming, and the information users can
        spread based on their positions in social network (Richardson and Domingos, 2002; Kempe and
        Kleinberg, 2003; Borgatti, 2005; Leskovec, Mcglohon, et al., 2007; Agarwal et al., 2008, 2012;
        Chen and Wang, 2009; Li et al., 2018). Likewise, complex networks on social platforms have
        been investigated to show how users‚Äô power in social networks (Kivran-Swaine, Govindan and
        Naaman, 2011; Chua, 2014) is used to spread, pass, and block information from other users.
        However, these methods investigated groups of influential users in the network, where these
        studies did not discover influential sets of individuals or reveal the users‚Äô interests in form of
        contexts or the participation in different platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
        We introduced focal structure analysis (FSA) for social networks in (≈ûen et al., 2016), where a
        greedy algorithm was developed to identify focal structures responsible for spreading fake news
        in social networks. We reported small influential sets of users responsible for influencing
        thousands of users on Facebook. In (Alassad, Agarwal and Hussain, 2019), we presented a
        bi-level centrality-modularity model to examine intensive groups of co-commenters spreading
        fake news in a YouTube channel. This was a significant advancement to the original FSA and
        hence was named FSA 2.0. Our model combined two well-known social network analysis
        methods viz., centrality methods and modularity method to bridge the shortcoming in traditional
        community detection methods used in graph theory. The resultant combination is a bi-level linear
        optimization problem to realize/observe the interactions between the user-level and
        network-level as presented in Figure 2. We explored hidden intensive groups and ranked them
        for further investigations. We found key information spreaders in a complex social network by
        using a bi-level decomposition optimization method in a YouTube channel spreading fake news
        about the South China Sea conflict where the authors monitored the impacts of suspending these
        key sets of spreaders from the network (Alassad, Hussain and Agarwal, 2019). In an extended
        study, we used computational social science techniques to identify coordinated cyber threats to
        smart cities networks (Alassad, Hussain and Agarwal, 2019). In this research, we identified
        intensive sets of aggressors, measured their power utilizing the deviant cyber flash mob detection
        method, and then analyzed the network‚Äôs changes when a focal structure was suspended from the
        network. We implemented a comprehensive decomposition optimization model for locating key
        sets of commenters spreading conspiracy theory in online social networks (Alassad, Hussain and
        Agarwal, 2021), as depicted in Figure 3. In addition, we combined advanced computational
        social science and graph theoretic techniques to reveal adversarial information operations in
        online social networks (Alassad, Spann and Agarwal, 2021). We studied computational social
        science techniques to identify coordinated cyber threats to smart city static infrastructure
        networks (Alassad et al., 2021)

    <p>
        Our newest advancement to focal structure analysis, i.e., contextual focal structure analysis
        approach (CFSA) leverages context to improve discovery and interpretability of focal structures
        in social networks. We use multiplex network formalism to implement the idea, where different
        network layers could be used to represent various contexts such as relations among individuals
        on different platforms (Twitter, blogs, Facebook, YouTube, etc.), content/information flow
        network (e.g., reply/mention/share network, hashtag network, topic network, link/URL graph,
        metadata inferred covert connections among entities). The network layers could have
        interconnections based on user-user and user-content relations. We extended our FSA model
        presented in Figure 2 by adopting the multiplex network formalism. The CFSA model is
        designed to consider nonlinear relationships of online users in social network, which can be
        conceptualized as different layers of the multiplex network as shown in Figure 4 below. We
        provide the technical intuition into the CFSA model. The model consists of three main
        components, viz., data collection, CFS sets discovery, and CFS sets validation and analysis, as
        presented in Figure 5.

    <p>
        Due to the complexities in the analysis of different social media platforms and the
        unpredictability in the users‚Äô behavior (where users have many accounts on different social
        media platforms), the CFSA model is helpful to implement and examine cross-platform focal
        structures. The model presented here would accept more layers to include cross-platform aspect
        of the problem domain, i.e., content shared on different social media / communication platforms
        could be added to the CFSA multiplex network formalism (i.e., expands ùê¥ matrix shown in
        Figure 4). Also, this is a systematic method to manage the added information about users, and
        expand the structure of the multiplex network to include the online users‚Äô participation from
        different social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.

    </p>
    <p>
        The outcomes from the CFSA model are summarized in three discoveries in any social networks
        to track misinformation campaigns and its actors as the campaign proceeds as follow:
        <br>
        1. Discovery of new activities between users.
        <br>
        2. Discovery of new activities between contexts on social networks (e.g., co-referenced
        content, videos, information actors/users/commenters, hashtags, platforms).
        <br>
        3. Discovery of new activities between users and contexts (e.g., key coordinating structures
        spanning multiple information campaigns).
