                </h5>
                <p>
                    We will discuss our approach to characterizing a dynamic social/campaign process. We will first
                    provide a theoretical framework to characterize a social campaign and describe various theoretical
                    constructs. Then, we will discuss operationalization of these constructs (computationally, and for
                    social media) to characterize the dynamics of a campaign. The characterization framework is depicted
                    in Figure 1. </p>

                <h5>Connective Action Based Framework</h5>
                <p>
                    We have developed a conceptual framework and computational method for determining when
                    technology-equipped crowd networks act together under connective action. Establishing this
                    theoretical framework will help develop predictive models to monitor an emerging connective action
                    event and determine the type of measures needed to support or counter the action. We propose to
                    evaluate the extent that actors leverage connective action techniques to orchestrate information
                    campaigns.
                    <br><br>
                    The computational methods used in social network analysis have opened the way for new approaches to
                    be used to understand the psychological and social processes that occur when users take part in
                    online social movements or digital activism. These techniques can provide insights to the underlying
                    mechanisms that drive the phenomenon we see during connective action. The personal action framing in
                    connective action offers in-depth insights about the role of identity in online movements such as
                    protests, demonstrations, and mis/dis information campaigns (e.g., leaderless vs collective).
                    Individual micro-actions, such as likes, mentions, and retweets, can contribute to collective action
                    by making social information visible to personal networks, thereby creating circumstances for
                    conditional cooperation (Spann, et al., 2020). The methods developed in this research offer rigorous
                    new complements to traditional qualitative methods that address some of the limitations or critiques
                    of the qualitative survey or manual
                    annotation approaches, such as it being time-consuming and labor-intensive to extract insights. The
                    use of computational methods to study the social science theories presented here can help
                    researchers identify the grievances, processes, and social dynamics emerging from this type of
                    cyber-collective movement that often serve as catalysts for such events (Agarwal et al., 2012;
                    2014). Opportunities for computational analysis as a complement to existing survey methods offer
                    in-depth insights about the role of identity in online movements. The use of computational methods
                    to study connective action is an understudied area that can also provide valuable insights into the
                    behavior and emergence of these movements.
                    <br><br>
                    We have developed a socio-computational framework to assess the formation of cyber-collective
                    communities, analyze interactions between actors and identify how they influence their communities.
                    The primary goal of this framework is to demonstrate how computational methods may be used to detect
                    and analyze connective action properties of collective identity, network organization, and
                    mobilization (see Figure 2). This is done by using natural language processing to show how
                    collective identities converge in social networks over time, using social network analysis to
                    demonstrate how structural cohesiveness and organization of connective action networks emerges over
                    time, and how ordinary differential equations can be used to determine when mobilization for an
                    information campaign has reached critical mass. This theoretical framework is guided by the relevant
                    social science theories of social and collective identity, resource mobilization through affordances
                    and interdependence (see Figure 3), diffusions of innovations, and collective action. This framework
                    will evolve over time by adding relevant theories and constructs. Further, computational
                    methodologies to operationalize the theoretical constructs will evolve as well by adding novel ways
                    of assessing nuanced cyber behaviors.

                <h5>Collective Identity </h5>
                <p>
                    Studies on computer-mediated communication shows that collective identity is strengthened by the
                    anonymity and immersion that occurs within online groups as demonstrated by a model known as Social
                    Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects (SIDE; Postmes, Spears and Lea, 1998; Spears and Postmes,
                    2015; Odag et al, 2019, p. 281). This amplification of social identity, as mediated by digital
                    interactions, can both heighten polarization and facilitate deviant behavior (Douglas & McGarty,
                    2002, as cited in Odag, et al, 2019, p. 281). As group members become increasingly aligned with
                    “group norms and expectations” their own attributes are suppressed and individuals “behave according
                    to how they believe other people from the same social category will behave” (Chan, 2010, p. 1315).
                    One aspect of this research probes the reliability of using NLP methods to measure the collective
                    identity that is formed from these deindividuation effects using an LDA unsupervised distributional
                    model to find the topics of discussion in online communities. We will apply principal component
                    analysis (PCA) of the topic distributions to measure the inter-topic similarity between the topics
                    being discussed within the online communities of participants in cyber protests. This NLP method
                    demonstrates how we use textual content to measure collective identity as it emerges. Our
                    experiments have demonstrated that as online protests or information campaigns peak, the distance
                    between measured topics begins to overlap as their behaviors and discussion topics become more
                    cohesive (Spann, et al., 2022b).
                </p>
                <h5>Network Organization</h5>
                <p>The second concept in examining connective action analyzes the structural components of an
                    information campaign network. The organizational components are identified by applying Girvan-Newman
                    modularity and community detection on the network, while also evaluating centrality methods. Our
                    experiments for the #stopthesteal information campaign have demonstrated that the structure of the
                    network also becomes more cohesive as measured by Girvan-Newman modularity, as an event emerges
                    (Spann, et al., 2022b). To measure the organizational component of the connective action network, we
                    examine how the information is spread between nodes and communities, i.e., communication network. If
                    the organizational logic follows a pattern of sequential diffusion and not mutual exchanges, the
                    information flow should be rather one-directional than reciprocal (Theocharis et al., 2017).
                    Organizational nature of a
                    communication network can be measured by calculating the degree centrality of the network
                    structures, where we measure the in-degree, out-degree, and betweenness centrality for each node and
                    then aggregate for the entire network. This approach can be used to characterize the
                    affordance-interdependence properties discussed in Figure 3. Communities with a low degree
                    centralization suggest a more decentralized communication than hierarchical or organizational
                    (Spann, et al., 2020). Our experiments for the #stopthesteal information campaign have demonstrated
                    that the structure of the network also becomes more cohesive as measured by Girvan-Newman
                    modularity, as an event emerges (Spann, et al., 2022b) as shown in Figure 4.

Decreasing modularity during November 3 – 10, 2020 indicates an emergence of cohesiveness and collectivity in the network. In other words, the network can be imagined as ‘coming together’. Lower values of modularity indicate a more cohesive network. Higher values indicate a more fractured network.

                <h5>Mobilization</h5>
                <p>
                    The mobilization aspect leverages the diffusion of innovations theory (DOI) to show how users adopt
                    into social media campaigns. The psychological and social behaviors that are understood from the DOI
                    model can be applied to social networks to categorize social media users into adoption categories
                    and to use diffusion curves to determine if a campaign has reached its tipping point (see Figure 5).
                    We demonstrate this application of DOI theory to social networks in (Spann, et al., 2022a), where we
                    show how the spread of misinformation follows a trajectory pattern similar to the adoption of new
                    technologies. The framework presented here considers these two approaches to understanding the
                    diffusion of information in a connective action campaign. This view can be used to help shape
                    collective identity and understand whether a collective response is a function of aggregation
                    effects or specific interaction conditions within a group. This research also considers how online
                    social networks are used for the purpose of social media campaigns. The sociotechnical theories of
                    affordance and interdependence amongst users are applied to understand how individual user
                    participation impacts the rate of adoption into an information campaign. The interactions between
                    users in a connective action campaign can provide insights to help determine how future actors will
                    react as information propagates through the network. Leonardi distinguished between these types of
                    actions by labeling them as individualized, shared, and collective affordances (Leonardi, 2013). The
                    interdependencies created between users (see Figure 6) creates a production function that allows us
                    to measure the diffusion of information in a cyber campaign. The initial observations from our
                    analysis support a mathematical characterization for connective action campaigns and show how
                    affordances can be used to identify the inter-user message strategy (Spann, et al., 2020).

                <h5>s-Function Characteristics</h5>
                <p>
                    We leverage the diffusion of innovations theory to examine the trajectory of the overall campaign as
                    it evolves. The second derivative test is then applied to identify changes in the slope of the
                    s-curve. The second derivative test is a method in multivariable calculus used to determine if a
                    critical point of a function is a local minimum, maximum, or saddle point. This empirical approach
                    provides an initial quantitative method to find the points at which the slope of the curves shifts
                    from the accelerating stage to the point at which the campaign reaches maximum diffusion or critical
                    mass, and when the slope flattens out or enters the decelerating stage. Since DOI theory has been
                    applied to various disciplines, a key benefit to this approach is that the s-curves are platform
                    independent. Understanding these processes provides a foundation for predicting when an information
                    campaign reaches critical mass.
                </p>

                <h5>Detection and Impact Assessment (Operationalization)</h5>
                <p>To evaluate this framework, we will use our existing data repositories (and collect new) such as
                    COVID-19 anti-lockdown protests on Twitter for Operation Gridlock and the armed protests that
                    resulted in the shutdown of the Michigan State Capitol, protests from the Stop the Steal rallies
                    resulting from the 2020 presidential election, and misinformation campaigns propagating COVID-19
                    misinformation. The Michigan protest data contained 16,383 tweets from 9,985 users mentioning
                    #MichiganProtest, #MiLeg, #Endthelockdown, and #LetMiPeopleGo hashtags were collected over a 50-day
                    period from April 01, 2020 to May 20, 2020 (see Figure 7). Twitter data was collected for the
                    #stopthesteal protests from January 1, 2020 through January 31, 2021 resulting in 838,395 tweets
                    (see Figure 4). Nine COVID-19 misinformation and public discourse hashtags are being used in our
                    experiments and include a broad range of topics related to COVID-19 such as lockdowns, facemasks,
                    and vaccines (see Figure 8). The topics were chosen around highly debated issues that may have some
                    call to action consistent with connective action campaigns.

                <p>As misinformation campaigns evolve, actors are utilizing multiple platforms to evolve their TTPs for
                    recruitment and mobilization into collective action campaigns. We’re seeing a near real-time shift
                    in behaviors of the online social media information environment. Due to recent shutdowns of many
                    accounts, fringe users are leaving popular platforms for other more secure/encrypted, less
                    restrictive or less moderated, and decentralized modes of communication. As a result, we have to
                    keep up with this changing environment and adapt our theoretical framework, computational models,
                    data collection, and analysis strategies to stay relevant. Two notable changes to the current
                    environment are the platforms and techniques being used for disseminating information and
                    orchestrating protests. We are currently examining other platforms such as YouTube, Parler, and
                    Reddit to further validate our connective action methods. (McNerney et al., 2022) Table 1 shows the

                <p>We offer an approach to understanding collective action theory by providing the scientific community
                    with a new way to evaluate the concepts associated with connective action while generating results
                    that are interpretable and useful across disciplines. Our research is grounded in the theoretical
                    behavioral theories that are catalysts for social movements, while the computational techniques
                    presented here provide novel, scalable, and extensible methods to understand collective identity,
                    network organization, and mobilization in connective action movements. There have been limited
                    computational studies examining the sociological and organizational concepts of connective action. A
                    major impediment to quickly understanding the behaviors that drive these cyber-crowd/movements is
                    that they often require interviews and surveys of the participants to extract detailed information
                    about who is at the center of organizing these groups, what identities the group associates itself
                    with, and how or why people were drawn in to participate. Computational analysis as a complement to
                    existing survey methods offers in-depth insights about the role of identity in online movements.
                    Some of these studies have taken an analytical approach to focus on individual properties of
                    connective action and how it differs from collective action, but there is no research that brings
                    all the concepts together under a computational social science approach. The research and framework
                    presented here provide a strong foundation for this important area of emerging socio-technical
                    behaviors. The case studies presented here have highlighted the social science and behavioral
                    theories involved in understanding social identity and affordances in social networks,
                    interdependence, and resource mobilization through critical mass theory. This work presents a
                    theoretical framework for operationalizing connective action theory using computational methods
                    grounded in social network analysis and provides. This interdisciplinary approach bridges social
                    science theories with computational science techniques to advance the computational social science
                    discipline. In the context of connective action, these computational methods offer a new way to
                    quickly identify behaviors and attributes shared within a social movement, which provides an
                    important step in advancing the understanding of the emergence of collective action on digital
                    platforms.
