<div class="solid-line"></div>
<p>
    Multimedia rich OIE specific tactics are multifaceted and use multiple modalities of information. We
    will explain how we characterize these tactics and conduct impact assessment. Various multimedia
    rich OIE specific tactics have been identified in our studies and from the literature. These tactics
    are characterized by their multi-faceted detection and impact assessment, i.e., network (N), content
    (C), and/or platform affordance (P). Each of these facets (network, content, and platform
    affordance) in turn requires analysis of a variety of information modalities (text, audio, video,
    images, network, URLs, metadata, algorithms, etc.). A content taxonomy of the various information
    modalities is included
    <br><br>
    A list of these tactics is presented below, along with their respective characterization (N, C,
    and/or P), also illustrated in Figure 1:

    <br>&#x2022; Discourse shift (C)
    <br>&#x2022; Shallow/deep fakes (C)
    <br>&#x2022; Content cloning/repurposing (C)
    <br>&#x2022; Algorithmic bias exploitation (P)
    <br>&#x2022; Long term/short term game (P)
    <br>&#x2022; Artificial engagement boosting (P)
    <br>&#x2022; Coordinated content push (N,C)
    <br>&#x2022; Discourse fusion (N,C)
    <br>&#x2022; Emotion/Toxicity cue (C,N)
    <br>&#x2022; Cross-platform coordination (P,N,C)
    <br>&#x2022; Coordinated deep fake (P,N,C)

    While some tactics leverage content, network, or platform affordances, others depend on a combination of two or all three facets. For instance, content cloning/repurposing leverages content facet, however, coordinated content push leverages both content and network facet. On the other hand, coordinated deep fake tactic leverages all three facets, i.e., network, content, and platform affordance. Figure 2 illustrates this multi-faceted characterization of multimedia rich OIE specific tactics by positioning the tactic closer to the facets leveraged by the said tactic.

    For each tactic, we are developing and refining analytics to detect and measure its impact. These
    analytics are presented as a playbook to show what data elements are needed, how to process the data
    elements, and the analytical methodology to detect and measure the impact. A comprehensive
    characterization of the rich data environment of multimedia OIE and characterization of multimodal
    multimethod analytical methodologies for multimedia OIE are depicted in Figures 3 and 4,
    respectively.
