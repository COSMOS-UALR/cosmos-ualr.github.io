<h5>Commenter Flash Mob</h5>
<h6>Definition</h6>
<p>A type of coordinated inauthentic behavior, commenter flash mob is a tactic where a seemingly
    arbitrary group of commenters collectively comment on a (or a set of) video(s). Such an act seems
    uncoordinated to an outsider but there is a sophisticated coordination in their activity, like a
    flash mob. Their comments may or may not be relevant to the video content. Some examples of
    coordinated commenter flash mobs are shown in Figure 1 (left). As a contrasting example, a regular
    commenter behavior is shown in Figure 1 (right). Some of the commenter flash mobs shown in figure 1
    (left) comprises of groups of commenters who co-commented on over 100 videos. Such commenter flash
    mobs can create a perception of a content being popular thereby helping increase its virality.
