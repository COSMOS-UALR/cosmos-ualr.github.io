<!--Coordinated Content Push-->
<h5>Coordinated Content Push</h5>
<h5>Definition</h5>
<p>A type of coordinated behavior, coordinated content push is a tactic where a group of information
    actors (e.g., channels on YouTube) post identical or similar content. The group of information
    actors could post identical videos, similar videos, portions of a video embedded in another, may use
    similar content production styles, similar background/foreground images in their video, same/similar
    audio, speech, text, etc. Figure 1 shows two different channels that pushed same videos with
    identical titles. Further, the group members may also follow each other (as subscribers) and/or
    deploy other tactics such as commenter flash mobs. Often content from the group of channels is
    recommended by the platform and shows up in the ‘related videos’ stream of each other.

<p><b>Figure 1. </b>Shows a group of information actors on YouTube that deployed coordinated content push
    tactic. These channels posted highly similar to identical videos, with same/similar titles,
    same/similar audio transcript, and used robotic voice narration. Further, these channels also
    deployed commenter flash mob tactic. Due to these tactics, content from these channels show up in
    each other’s related video stream.
