                <p>
                    Discourse/narrative fusion is a tactic where different topics (that may or may not be related) are injected in a discourse in an attempt to conflate issues, raise popularity/visibility of one topic through the other, bridge related echo chambers, and fabricate a perception of relevance of the topic or support for the topic in society. This tactic could also result in exploitation of algorithmic bias. Narrative/discourse mixing could also help in detection of code-switching tactics. 
                    <br><br>Commenter networks stretch beyond a channel. Cross-channel commenter networks allow identification of discourse fusion tactics. Figure 1 (left) shows an example of isolated discourse on YouTube. The discourse tends to stay localized to a video or a channel. Commenters prefer to stick to a channel or a video. They comment and leave. Isolated discourse is largely observed on mainstream news and politics category channels. People rarely watch the same news on different YouTube channels much less commenting on the same news story on different channels, hence a very sparsely brokered discourse network. On the other hand, Figure 1 (right) shows an example of discourse fusion tactic, where people have bridged various discourse communities by co-commenting. In this example, people have co-commented on a variety of COVID-19 misinformation promoting videos, anti-vaccination ideology promoting videos, and conspiracy theory promoting content on YouTube. Thereby, creating a highly brokered discourse network that pushes YouTube’s algorithms to consider such content related and show them as such in related video streams.
