                    Toxicity in discourse is an important signal for an I&W system as it could forecast brewing unrest, impending attacks, and any hateful rhetoric that may lead to a violent outcome. Toxicity has been shown to be contagious in our prior work (Figure 1 and 2) (Obadimu et al., 2021). It is important to study what happens to a community when toxicity spreads, as it helps in assessing <b>connective action properties of an emerging cyber-social threat</b>. In our studies, increase in toxicity has led to splintering of communities, as seen in figures 3, 4, and 5. Granger Causality test is used to determine causality relation between toxicity and community dynamics (number of communities over time). In our preliminary study for COVID pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine dataset, we found that toxicity’s effect on community dynamics was most pronounced on second and third day. This suggests a lag of 2-3 days before an increase in toxicity may lead to fracturing of a community (DiCicco, 2022). In some ways, rise in toxicity could serve as an early indicator of polarization and collective identity emergence.

                    Further, social bots can be synchronized to cause viral contagion such as toxicity! This is an important signal, as it not only examines the presence of bots but their impact on the discourse and thereby community dynamics. <br>
                    <br>
                    Bot activity is observed to be positively correlated with toxicity. Increase (or decrease) in number of bots is strongly correlated with increase (or decrease) in toxicity (Figure 6). 
                    <br><br>
                    We can collate the three signals i.e., toxicity, network structure measures, and bot frequencies to detect deliberate amplification of the process of enhancing collective identity of a group or manufacturing polarization in an online community.

                    This shows one way of putting together multiple signals derived from social media to offer rigorous and more timely view in the behaviors of crowds on social media.

                    This example also offers a view into the complexity of scenarios – not all scenarios may provide same set of meaningful signals.
