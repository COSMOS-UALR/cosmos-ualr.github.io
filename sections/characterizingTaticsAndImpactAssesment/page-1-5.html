<!--Content Cloning/Repurposing-->
<h5>Content Cloning/Repurposing</h5>
<h6>Definition</h6>
<p>
    A type of tactic, where an information actor (e.g., channel on YouTube) would appropriate content (e.g., a video) in
    part or in entirety from other channels. Content similarity could range from being highly similar to completely
    identical. Similar content could include video, audio, text, or all of these. Such content cloning/repurposing has a
    two-fold advantage. First, it helps in content amplification, thereby increasing the chances of the content being
    recommended by the platform’s content recommendation/related feed curation algorithms. Second, if offensive content
    is removed/suspended by the platform citing platform’s policy violation, then the copy of the content ensures
    continued access and distribution.
    <br><br>
    An example of content repurposing is shown in Figure 1. Two pairs of highly similar videos are shown. Our video
    barcode approach was used to detect content similarity. Figure 2 shows the barcode of a pair of videos with portions
    of high similarity identified.

    Barcode based video similarity assessment could be used to identify clusters of videos cloning/ repurposing content
    from other videos/channels. Figure 3 shows clusters of videos with highly similar to completely identical content.
    Different colors correspond to various clusters. Highly similar videos are placed very close to each other, while
    identical videos are superimposed on one another. These clusters are interpreted using topic models on the text
    available through the videos’ titles, description, and transcripts. Cluster interpretations are shown in Figure 4.
