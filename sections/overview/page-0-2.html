    <h5>The Missing Element: Multimedia Platforms and Multimodal Characterization</h5>
    <p>
        Each analytical and conceptual framework mentioned above offers value to the assessment of online
        influence operations. However, the relevant literature and policy-relevant toolkit still lack a
        framework that would, in combination with some of the existing frameworks, address the emerging
        characteristics of multimedia platforms and cross-platform dynamics in the contemporary information
        environment. Most of the existing analytical workflows rely on text-based analysis of threat actors
        and information manipulation incidents, with limited, time-consuming, and mostly qualitative
        assessments of the artifacts, content, or actors present in multimedia environments. In addition,
        most of the current knowledge regarding the online influence operations relies on the given
        analytical workflows and text-based computational tools, which in turn pose significant limitations
        to the overarching understanding of how current hostile operations are conducted, or which artifacts
        they use. Furthermore, existing frameworks focus on platforms that are primarily user-centric (e.g.,
        Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp). Emerging multimedia based platforms (e.g., YouTube, TikTok, Parler,
        Clubhouse) are primarily content-centric. TTPs of influence operations are shaped by the platform
        architectures, and what is available as manipulative tools. By mostly relying on the text-based
        tools that are mostly applied to data originating from a certain list of social media platforms such
        as Twitter, the overwhelming majority of the current frameworks often fall short of offering a
        comprehensive view of how multiple modalities of signals from video, audio, text, network,
        user/content-engagement, and platform affordances are combined.

        Therefore, we propose building an additional framework, with an emphasis on multimedia environments,
        to complement the existing frameworks of hostile influence operations.
