        We leverage the diffusion of innovations (DOI) theory to show how users adopt into social
        media campaigns. The psychological and social behaviors that are understood from the DOI
        model can be applied to social networks to categorize social media users into adoption categories
        and to use diffusion curves to determine if a campaign has reached its tipping point (see Figure
        2). We demonstrate this application of DOI theory to social networks in (Spann, et al., 2022),
        where we show how the spread of misinformation follows a trajectory pattern similar to the
        adoption of new technologies. The framework in this proposal considers these two approaches to
        understanding the diffusion of information in a connective action campaign. This view can be
        used to help shape collective identity and understand whether a collective response is a function
        of aggregation effects or specific interaction conditions within a group. This research also
        consider how online social networks are used for the purpose of social media campaigns. The
        sociotechnical theories of affordance and interdependence amongst users are applied to
        understand how individual user participation impacts the rate of adoption into an information
        campaign. The interactions between users in a connective action campaign can provide insights
        to help determine how future actors will react as information propagates through the network.
        Leonardi distinguished between these types of actions by labeling them as individualized, shared,
        and collective affordances (Leonardi, 2013). The interdependencies created between users
        creates a production function that allows us to measure the diffusion of information in a cyber
        campaign. The initial observations from our analysis support a mathematical characterization for
        connective action campaigns and show how affordances can be used to identify the inter-user
        message strategy (Spann, et al., 2020).

        We leverage the diffusion of innovations (DOI) theory to examine the trajectory of the overall
        campaign as it evolves. The second derivative test is then applied to identify changes in the slope
        of the s-curve. The second derivative test is a method in multivariable calculus used to determine
        if a critical point of a function is a local minimum, maximum or saddle point. This empirical
        approach provides an initial quantitative method to find the points at which the slope of the
        curves shifts from the accelerating stage to the point at which the campaign reaches maximum
        diffusion or critical mass, and when the slope flattens out or enters the decelerating stage. Since
        DOI theory has been applied to various disciplines, a key benefit to this approach is that the s-
        curves are platform independent. Understanding these processes provides a foundation for
